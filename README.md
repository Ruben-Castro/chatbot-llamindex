# What did I learn 
I learned how to use LlamaIndex to streamline the development of RAG-powered LLMs to create a chatbot. This approach can 
be applied to any company's proprietary data to develop chatbots that assist employees. For example, It can be used to create 
customer service chatbots that help customer service representatives answer common questions by making all of the company's proprietary troubleshooting documentation available to the LLM for tailored responses. It can also help large organizations make LLMs Answer questions relevant to their domain without LLM retraining. Saving thousands of dollars and quickly adopting this revolutionizing technology.
